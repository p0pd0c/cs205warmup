[DB SCHEMA AND DATA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10uNZty7Ix6n4S_ww2qhkvcJ7jfikw8rN0CeShY-WSuE/edit?usp=sharing)

[PRESENTATION](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12EugwYQW6lgqt0djMILuD6K_ihHnTbOqu1pTB_NQdDw/edit?usp=sharing)

## Requirements
Must have python 3.9 or greater
Must have the following libraries installed via pip: shlex, csv, sqlite3

## Running the program
Colocate the csv files with the main, parser, and sqlinterface python scripts

Run the following in your command line to start the query shell:
```
python main.py
```

### Interacting with the shell
While the program is running, try giving some commands to the query engine...
It will show you a list of commands.

Before the user can query the data, they must first issue:
```
load data
```
Otherwise the shell will tell the user that the database hasn't been initialized. 

### Example Queries

For example, the net profit query:
```
net profit director "Christopher Nolan"
```
Would yield the amount of money generated by Christopher Nolan after the budgets for all his movies are subtracted. 

What if you wanted to know who the most successful director is?
```
most successful director
```

And if you wanted to know what movies are by that director?
```
which movies by "Christopher Nolan"
```

There are many more commands supported by the query engine, and if you ever forget, you can activate the help menu at any time by entering an invalid command
```
help me please!
```
